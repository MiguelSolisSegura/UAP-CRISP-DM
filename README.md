# UAP Sightings
This project contains an exploration of three business questions related to Unidentified Aerial Phenomena. For this matter, the CRISP-DM methodology has been employed. Refer to the following sections for an understanding on where is every step of methodology discussed.

# Acknowledgments

Data used for this experiment comes from the [National UFO Reporting Center](https://nuforc.org/). The original data can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/NUFORC/ufo-sightings).

# Business Understanding

Three main questions are explored:

- Where is the best location to establish a touristic complex, so that visitors have a high chance for UAP sightings.
- How does the frequency of reports have evolved over time in the chosen area.
- Is there any identifiable relationship between the geographic coordinates and time, with reported UAP shapes.

# Data Understanding to Evaluation

Refer to the commentaries and code on the `notebook.ipynb` file for an explanation on these steps.

# Deployment

A general discussion on this project for non-technical readers can be found [here](https://medium.com/@miguelsolissegura/something-out-of-this-world-for-your-next-vacations-1cb44fb246a6). The main findings can be summarized as: 

- The best location for UAP sightings in the United States, is California.
- Since 1995, an exponential increase on reports is present both globally and in the area of interest.
- There is not an evident relationship between geographic coordinates or time, with reported UAP shapes.
